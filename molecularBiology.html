        <h2>DNA Replication</h2>
        <p>DNA replication is the process by which DNA makes a copy of itself during cell division.This happens through three main steps:</p>

        <dl>
          <dt>Initiation</dt>
          <dd>The DNA separates its complemetary strands.</dd>
          <dt>Elongation</dt>
          <dd>The newly separated nucleotides then accept new complementary nucleotides, created two strands.</dd>
          <dt>Termination</dt>
          <dd>The backbones of the two DNA strands are secured and the DNA checks itself for any problems.</dd>
        </dl>

        <h2>Mutations</h2>
        <p>Mutation: an aleration in the nucleotide sequence of the genome of an organism, virus, or extrachromosomal DNA. There are two major types of mutations:</p>

        <dl>
          <dt>Germline Mutations</dt>
          <dd>Occur in gametes. Thse mutations are especially significant  because they can be transmitted to offspring and every cell in the offspring will have the mutation.</dd>
          <dt>Somatic Mutations</dt>
          <dd>Occur in the cells of the body. These mutations may have little effect on the organism because they are confined to just one cell and its daughter cell. Somatic mutations cannot be passed to offspring.</dd>
        </dl>

        <p>There are also different ways genetric material is changed. The three major ways they change are:</p>
        <dl>
          <dt>Chromosomal Alterations</dt>
          <dd>Mutations that change chromosome structure. There are five different ways these occur:</dd>
          <dd>- Deletion: Part of the chromosome structure is deleted</dd>
          <dd>- Duplication: Part of the chromosome structure is duplicated</dd>
          <dd>- Inversion: Part of the chromosome structure is inverted or flipped</dd>
          <dd>- Insertion: Part of the chromosome structure is inserted into another part of the chromosome structure</dd>
          <dd>- Translocation: Part of a chromosome structure is translocated to part of another chromosome structure</dd>
          <dt>Point Mutations</dt>
          <dd>A change of a single nucleotide in DNA. This type of mutation isn't as serious as chromosomal alterations. There are three different types of point mutations.</dd>
          <dd>- Silent: the mutated codon codes for the same amino acid as the original codon</dd>
          <dd>- Missense: the mutated codon codes for a different amino acid than the original codon</dd>
          <dd>- Nonsense: the mutated codon codes for a premature stop in place of what the original codon coded for</dd>
          <dt>Frameshift Mutations</dt>
          <dd>A deletion or insertion of one or more nucleotides that changes the reading frame of the base sequence. Deletions remove nucleotides and insertions add nucleotides.</dd>
