        <h2>Transport</h2>
        <p>There are two main ways molecules are transported inside the cell. The first is through passive transport and the second is through active transport.</p>
        <h4>Passive Transport</h4>
        <dl>
          <dt>Passive transport is a type of transportation does not require energy. There are multiple examples of passive transport including:</dt>
          <dd>- The difference in concentration between the inside and outside of cells, making the concentration even out inside and outside the cell.</dd>
          <dd>- Osmisis: the movement of water molecules across the cell membrane.</dd>
        </dl>
        <h4>Active Transport</h4>
        <dl>
          <dt>Active transport is a type of transportation that does require energy. There are multiple types of active transport including:</dt>
          <dd>- Exocytosis is the process in which a large amount of molecules are moved out of the cell by secreting them through an energy-dependent process.</dd>
          <dd>- Endocytosis is the process in which a large amount of molecules are moved into the cell through an energy-dependent process.</dd>
        </dl>
        <h4>Types of Osmosis</h4>
        <p>Osmosis is a process by which molecules of a solvent tend to pass through a semipermeable membrane from a less concentrated solution into a more concentrated one, thus equalizing the concentrations on each side of the membrane. There are three different states one side of osmosis can exist in. These are:</p>
        <dl>
          <dt>Hypertonic</dt>
          <dd>- The hypertonic state of osmosis is when the side of the membrane in question has a higher concentration of molecules than the other side.</dd>
          <dt>Hypotonic</dt>
          <dd>- Contrary to the hypertonic state of the side of the membrane in question, the side is in a hypotonic state when it has a lower concentration of molecules than the other side.</dd>
          <dt>Isotonic</dt>
          <dd>- When one side of the membrane in question has the same concentration as the other, it is in a isotonic state, meaning both sides have the exact same concentration of molecules. The isotonic state of both sides of a membrane is the final product of osmosis.</dd>

        <h2>Energy in Plants</h2>
        <p>The energy consumed by plants is created within the plant and not consumed. This is happens through photosynthesis which is a process in which plants mainly use sunlight, to create glucose and ATP, otherwise known as Adenosine Triphosphate.</p>
        <h4>Glucose & ATP</h4>
        <p>Photosynthesis is the process by which energy is created within a plant. The two main types of energy photosynthesis creates are glucose and ATP.</p>
        <dl>
          <dt>Glucose</dt>
          <dd>- The chemical formula for glucose is C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>H<sub>6</sub>. It is the "deliverable" form of energy produced by photosynthesis, yet it is also used in almost every other type of life in this world, making it a universal food.</dd>
          <dt>ATP</dt>
          <dd>- ATP is considered the "energy currency" of the cell because it is capable of releasing just the right amount of energy to fuel the processes within the cell.</dd>
        </dl>
        <h4>Stages of Photosynthesis</h4>
        <dl>
          <dt>Stage I - Light Reactions</dt>
          <dd>- This stage uses water and changes light energy from the sun into chemical energy stored in ATP and NADPH, while releasing oxygen as a bidproduct.</dd>
          <dt>Stage II - Calvin Cycle</dt>
          <dd>- This stage combines carbon from carbon dioxide in the air and uses the chemical energy in ATP and NADPH to make glucose.</dd>
        </dl>
        <h4>Chloroplast</h4>
        <p>The location in which photoynthesis occurs is the chloroplast. This happens in the internal membranes that stack on top of each other within the chloroplast.</p>
        <dl>
          <dt>Structure of Chloroplast</dt>
          <dd>Grana</dd>
          <dd>- Grana consists of thylakoid membranes, which are sac-like membranes that are used during the first stage of photosynthesis.</dd>
          <dd>- Thylakoid membranes contain photosystems, which are groups of molecules that include chlorophyll, the pigment that makes plants green.</dd>
          <dd>- The second phase of photosynthsis occurs outside of the thylakoid membranes in a space called the stroma.</dd>

        <h2>Energy in Animals</h2>
        <p>Unlike plants, animals consume energy throught the process of eating and drinking. Even though the process of making or consuming energy is different, both plant and animal cells use ATP.</p>
        <h4>Cellular Respiration</h4>
        <p>Cellular respiration is the process in which energy is released in glucose to make ATP. This seemingly simple, yet actually complex process is the basis for all living animal cells.</p>
        <h2>Stages of Cellular Respiration</h2>
        <dl>
          <dt>Glycolysis</dt>
          <dd>- During glycolysis, a glucose molecule is broken down to form two molecules of pyruvic acid, which are called pyruvate.</dd>
          <dt>Krebs Cycle/Citric Acid Cycle</dt>
          <dd>- During the Krebs cycle, the two molecules of pyruvate are then oxidized, creating two acetyl-CoA molecules and leaving two molecules of carbon dioxide.</dd>
          <dt>Electron Transport Stage</dt>
          <dd>-During the electron transport stage of cellular respiration, energy from NADH and FADH<sub>2</sub> is transferred to ATP. THe energy is used to pump hydrogen ions across the inner membrane of the mitochondria, from the matrix into the intermembrane space.</dd>
        </dl>
        <h2>Structure of a Mitochondrion</h2>
        <dl>
          <dt>Inner membrane</dt>
          <dd>- The inner membrane is the second membrane, only enclosed by the outer membrane.</dd>
          <dd>- The third stage of cellular respiration takes place <i>on</i> the inner membrane.</dd>
          <dt>Matrix</dt>
          <dd>- The matrix is the space enclosed by the inner membrane. It consists of most of the objects within the mitochondira, including ribosomes, granules, and DNA.</dd>
          <dd>- The third stage of cellular respiration takes place in the matrix.</dd>
