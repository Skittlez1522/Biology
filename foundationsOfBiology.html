        <h2>Defining Life</h2>
        <p>Life can be defined in many ways, but there is a list of characteristics that scientifically defines life. The characteristics are:</p>
        <dl>
          <dt>It responds to the environment</dt>
          <dd>- All living things detect change in their environment</dd>
          <dd>- Ex. If you step close to a mouse, it will respond by running away.</dd>
          <dt>It grows and develops</dt>
          <dd>- All living things grow and develop</dd>
          <dd>- Ex. A tadpole slowly grows into a frog</dd>
          <dt>It produces offspring</dt>
          <dd>- All living things are capable of reproduction</dd>
          <dd>- Ex. A single cell splits into two daughter cells</dd>
          <dt>It maintains homeostasis</dt>
          <dd>- All living things are capable of maintaining a stable internal environment</dd>
          <dd>- Ex. The human body shivers when it is cold to maintian a stable internal temperature</dd>
          <dt>It has complex history</dt>
          <dd>- All living things consists of large, complex molecules</dd>
          <dd>- Ex. The human body has metabolism, which is the accumulated total of all the biochemical reactions occuring in a cell or organism</dd>
          <dt>It consists of cells</dt>
          <dd>- All living things consist of atleast one cell</dd>
          <dd>- Animals and humans have different types of cells, but they still have cells</dd>

        <h2>Principles of Biology</h2>
        <p>The Unifying Principles of Biology are what form the basis of biology. There are four principles of biology, which are:</p>
        <dl>
          <dt>Cell Theory</dt>
          <dd>- The theory that all living things are made up of cells</dd>
          <dt>Gene Theory</dt>
          <dd>- The theory that the characteristics of living organisms are controlled by genes</dd>
          <dt>Homestasis</dt>
          <dd>- The idea in which a living thing maintains a stable internal environment</dd>
          <dt>Evolution</dt>
          <dd>- the change in the characteristics of living things over time</dd>
        <dl>

        <h2>Interdependence of Living Things</h2>
        <p>All living things depend on other living things to survive. For example, all animals rely on plants to provide them oxygen. This is called interdependence. Interdependence comes in two forms:</p>
        <dl>
          <dt>Symbiosis</dt>
          <dd>- A close relationship between organisms of different species in which at least one of the organisms benefits</dd>
          <dd>- Ex. Birds eat parasites from a deer's fur</dd>
          <dt>Competition</dt>
          <dd>- A relatinship between living things that depend on the same resources</dd>
          <dd>- Ex. Animals in a desert rely on water, but only the best get the little water that is in a desert</dd>

        <h2>Molecular Biology</h2>
        <p>Molecular biology is the base of all biology for one main reason: all living things are made up of molecules</p>
        <dl>
          <dt>Carbon</dt>
          <dd>Carbon is essential to life on earth because of its ability to form stable bonds with many elements.</dd>
          <dd>Over 10 million carbon-based compounds</dd>
          <dd>Four major types of carbon-based compounds: carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, nucleic acids.</dd>
          <dt>Carbohydrates</dt>
          <dd>A carbohydrate is an organic compound such as sugar or starch, and is used to store energy.</dd>
          <dd>Monosaccharides are simple sugars such as fructose or glucose.</dd>
          <dd>Disaccharides are two monosaccharides bonded together</dd>
          <dd>Polysaccharides are complex carbohydrate molecules that form when simple sugars bind together in a chain.</dd>
          <dd>Complex carbohydrates have two main functions: storing energy and forming structures of living things</dd>
          <dt>Proteins</dt>
          <dd>A protein is an organic compound made up of small molecules called amino acids</dd>
          <dd>There are 20 different amino acids commonly found in the proteins of living organims.</dd>
          <dd>A polypeptide is a long chain of bonded amino acids. A protein consists of one or more polypeptide chains.</dd>
          <dd>Proteins serve many different roles in living things. Some of these rolls are:</dd>
          <dd>- Helping cells keep their structure</dd>
          <dd>- Make up tissue cells</dd>
          <dd>- Sending and recieving signals</dd>
          <dd>- Some, called enzymes, help speed up chemical reactions in cells</dd>
          <dd>- Some, called anitbodies, target substances like bacteria for destruction</dd>
          <dd>- Carry messages</dd>
          <dd>- Transport materials</dd>
          <dt>Lipids</dt>
          <dd>A lipid is an organic compound such as fat or oil.</dd>
          <dd>Lipids are mainly used to store energy, and consist of repeating units called fatty acids.</dd>
          <dd>There are two main fatty acids: saturated fatty acids and unsaturated fatty acids.</dd>
          <dd>Saturated Fatty Acids</dd>
          <dd>- Carbon atoms are bonded to as many hydrogen atoms as possible.</dd>
          <dd>- Very straight, creating a solid at room temperature.</dd>
          <dd>- Used by animals to store energy</dd>
          <dd>Unsaturated Fatty Acids</dd>
          <dd>- Carbon atoms are bonded to hydrogen atoms in groups, causing the chains to bend.</dd>
          <dd>- Liquid at room temperature</dd>
          <dd>- Used by plants to store energy</dd>
          <dd>There are different types of lipids that also contain alcohol or phosphate groups. These lipids are:</dd>
          <dd>- Triglycerids</dd>
          <dd>- Phospholipids</dd>
          <dd>- Steroids</dd>
          <dt>Nucleic Acid</dt>
          <dd>A nucleic acid is an organic compound, such as DNA or RNA, that is built of small units called nucleotides.</dd>
          <dd>Many nucleotides binded together form a chain called a polynucleotide. RNA consists of just one polynucleotide chain. DNA consists of two polynucleotide chains.</dd>
          <dd>Each nucleotide consists of three smaller molecules:</dd>
          <dd>- Sugar</dd>
          <dd>- Phosphate groups</dd>
          <dd>- Nitrogen base</dd>
          <dd>There are four different types of nitrogen bases, which are:</dd>
          <dd>- Cytosine</dd>
          <dd>- Adenine</dd>
          <dd>- Guanine</dd>
          <dd>- Thymine</dd>
          <dd>Hydrogen bonds between complementary nitrogen bases, which are: Cytosine+Guanine and Adenine+Thymine.</dd>
          <dd>The role of nucleic acid is to store and show the correct sequence of amino acids in a protein.</dd>
          <dt>Biochemical Reactions</dt>
          <dd>A chemical reaction is a process that changes some chemical substances into others.</dd>
          <dd>Two parts of a chemical reaction:</dd>
          <dd>- Reactant: the substance that starts a chemical reaction</dd>
          <dd>- Product: the substance that forms as a result of a chemical reaction</dd>
          <dd>In a chemical reaction, the quantity of an element doesn't change; there is the same amount of elements in the products as there was the reactants.</dd>
