        <p>There are multiple reasons biology doesn't exist, but the main reason this "science" doesn't exist is because it is just a subscience of physics. Now, you may say, "That doesn't mean it can't exist," and this is where you're wrong:</p>
        <h4>In all honesty, I don't know why it doesn't exist, but just go with it please?</h4>
